<p>Soccer stadiums play host to the game that we all know and love, and there are many iconic stadiums around the world which are just as famous as the players that they welcome each week. Many of these stadiums are not just home to some of the most successful teams in the world, as many of them are an important part of that cityâ€™s history and cultural identity. They are tourist attractions which many soccer fans see as a pilgrimage, even if it is just to see the stadium from afar.</p>

<p>Each stadium has its own unique characteristics that make them synonymous with their team. Some smaller stadiums are notorious for having an imposing atmosphere for the visiting team, whilst some stadiums are so large that it can create a surreal and dizzying atmosphere for everyone inside.</p>

<p>There is no feeling quite like the walk up to a soccer stadium, joining up alongside your fellow supporters as the stadium looms ahead in distance. There is a sense of pride, belonging and anticipation as you draw nearer to the ground, with the sheer scale of the ground making it an awe inspiring sight.</p>
